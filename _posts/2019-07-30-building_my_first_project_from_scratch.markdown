After a few weeks of trial, error, and struggle, I've finally completed my first (very basic) ruby application!  Until I did, I had no idea how much I had been riding with training wheels in the previous Flatiron lessons.  Don't get me wrong, the lessons at Flatiron have been challenging and comprehensive, and I feel like I've learned a lot about object oriented programming in a short time.  But actually doing it yourself without someone else putting the specific goal in front of you is pretty different.

First, when you're going through a typical lesson, the specific behavior of your code is already decided for you.  The tests have been written, and the output of your methods has been stated up front.  Coding a new project from scratch means YOU have to decide what that output looks like.  YOU have to decide how your objects will interact with each other, what data they should contain, and what methods they will need to do their jobs.  Having to make those choices for myself was kind of an eye opening experience, and one I frequently didn't get exactly right on the first attempt.  Which brings me to the second thing I learned from this project:

Refactoring is a much bigger part of writing code than I had anticipated.  Several times along the way I would get a method working, move on to another piece of the program, and then realize that I needed to add a step to the previous method, or change its return value, or even carve out some of the functionality into a separate, new method.  I can bet that the more I have to refactor my own code after it's written, the better I'll be at planning it in advance, but refactoring will never fully go away.  

Finally, this little CLI app I've written is ridiculous.  It adds no real-world value, and basically just provides data that a user could get by going directly to the website I'm scraping.  And yet, I'm as proud of it as a father to a newborn, because I built it with my own two hands!  After all the struggle, finally having something to show for everything I've learned so far is really rewarding, and I can't wait to dive into the web based portion of the program so I can start building things I'm even more proud of.
