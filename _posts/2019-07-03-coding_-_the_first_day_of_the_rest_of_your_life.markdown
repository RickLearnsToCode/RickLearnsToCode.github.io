I hate tedium.  In my corporate finance career I've rubbed shoulders with a lot of hardcore accountants, and it's always boggled my mind how much they love it.  The neverending repetition, the monthly close cycle that is always the same - book the entries, write up work papers explaining the entries, finalize the reporting and close the books.  Rinse, repeat, always the same every month.  That's my personal vision of hell, and as my career has progressed I have had to engage with the accounting cycle more and more.  Learning to code is like a breath of fresh air - I am literally learning a new skill that will eliminate the need for boring, manual repetition.

I always gravitated toward the technical side of my finance roles.  Early on I spent a few months on a team rebuilding our company's budgeting system using VBA for excel.  That opened my eyes to the power of automating your work flow, and I've tried to use those techniques often ever since.  More recently I spent several years in a web-based business where I taught myself to use SQL to extract user and transactions data from our operational databases, so we could analyze it and make better decisions in running the business.  At that point I also started dabbling in R, Python, and realized that I want code to be a much bigger part of my career.

Compared to finance and accounting, writing code is really fun and satisfying.  It doesn't even feel like work, it's more like playing games and solving logic puzzles.  On top of it just being fun, programming allows you to create useful, reusable tools.  That goes right back to eliminating the tedious, repetitive work that I have always disliked, and will allow me to add more value to whatever team I'm working with.  Automating the boring stuff frees up your brain to focus on the more critical work of helping run a business.

A hidden benefit to a career in software is the increased flexibility.  Everything happens over a network or in the cloud these days, so there's not as much need for a team to be physically in the same location.  That opens up options for remote work, which means a software developer has access to a wider range of available jobs.  Software is used in pretty much every industry, which also increases career flexibility.  Finally, having these skills opens up opportunities for side gigs, freelancing, and hobby income.  All of this increased flexibility ultimately means more financial security and less risk.

I'm just beginning my journey towards software engineering, but these first few months have confirmed that I'm going to love my new career path.  I just wish I had started 10 years ago!
